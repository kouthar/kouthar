                    <h3>Problem </h3>
                    <p>
                       Airbnb has been a great way to search for trips for you and your friends and loved
                       ones. In certain relationships and partnerships, the costs associated with travel,
                       like accomodations, are split.<br><br>

                       Although lists of saved accomodation options can be shared with friends with an Airbnb
                       profile, Airbnb currently has <b>no way of booking and processing payments across group members.</b>
                   </p>

                    

                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>
                        This solution
                        solves the problems with booking as a group before, introducing sophisticated group management,
                         and the ability to budget, book, and pay separately.
                        The end product is an experience bult on top of Airbnb's current interface to ensure 
                        smooth onboarding, minimal user-learning, and consistency across the platform.

                    <p>By answering these questions, I was able to define the scope of the project,
                        and place restrictions over the features that might be associated with the solution. 
                        I decided
                        that due to the lack of inter-member communication on the app, and the fact 
                        that users may not be able to interact in person, that the solution would be
                        on the app or website, and required as little communication as possible.

                        <p>I created these user personas with Airbnb's diverse customer set in mind
                        to ensure that I was designing for real people with a diverse set of goals
                        and frustrations.<br> <br>Of the personas I made, I identified <b>two key groups of users:</b><br><br>

                        1. Users who are aware that they would like a better payment process<br>
                        2. Users who have different frustrations who would benefit from a better payment process <br><br>
                    
                        This helped me frame my design in a way that ensured the feature benefited all kinds of users.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Creating intuitive booking and payment flows</h2>

                    <p>I asked myself, <b>"How might I...</b><br>
                        ...ensure a consistent experience across the Airbnb app when adding this new feature?"<br>
                        ...ensure an intuitive experience for users who are new or seasoned Airbnb users?"<br>
                        ...ensure that all users are in agreement before a booking goes through?"</p>

                    <h3>User Flows</h3>

                    <div class="header-image-desktop">
                        <img src="assets/user-flows-airbnb.png" alt="">
                        <div class="vertical-divider"></div>
                        <p>
                            I put myself in the shoes of the users, and outlined a user flow of what steps a user 
                            must or could take in order to successfully book an accomodation in a group, namely 
                            the decisions users must take, and when. <br><br>

                            More questions came up, like: <br><br>
                            Would people want to book by rooms with set prices in the same unit, or would they want to decide on their own?<br><br>

                            The answer would lie in user research, but also with Airbnb's hosts. To suddenly impose a requirement on setting
                            individual prices for each space in their units would be additional friction for the hosts. So, if user research
                            does suggest that booking by room is preferrable to group members setting their own prices, it would have to be done
                            in phases. For this reason, I started with a design which allowed group members to decide who was paying what.
                           
                        </p>

                    <h3>Wireframing</h3>


                    <div class="header-image-desktop">
                        <img src="assets/wireframes-airbnb.png" alt="">
                        <div class="vertical-divider"></div>
                        <p>
                            Using the artefacts I created before, and with the user in mind, I started wireframing. 
                            I startd with creating a quick flow of wireframes which reflected the current flow that
                            users must go through to save and book trips on Airbnb. After setting that up, I created
                            wireframes which reflected the existing flow in order to maintain consistency across the app.
                            This would allow for minimal onboarding needed for existing users, and less onboarding needed
                            for new users, creating less friction. <br><br>

                            Some of the choices involved in maintaining this consistency included:<br><br>

                            1. Initiating the group feature under "Filters" where many booking options were rather than making Groups
                            its own button item, and<br>
                            2. Keeping created groups and their saved accomodations options under "Saved" under regular Lists rather than
                            introducing a new page. <br><br>

                            From there, I was ready to build my design!
                        </p>
                    </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Crafting a group booking and payment experience on existing features</h2>

                    <p>I made my high fidelity prototypes by mocking up existing screens from
                        the Airbnb app to maintain formatting and styleguide.

                    </p>

                    <h3>Mocking Airbnb's UI</h3>
                    <div class="vertical-divider"></div>
                    <div class="header-image-desktop">

                        <img src="assets/ui-airbnb.png" alt="" class="research-visual">

                    </div>

                    <div class="vertical-divider"></div>




                    <p>In order to make the Group Booking feature an extension of the existing Airbnb
                        app, I had to make sure I mocked Airbnb's UI, from components, to font styles,
                        to selection tools. <br><br>

                        In order to achieve an identical UI visual and experience, I screenshotted real
                        frame equivalents from the Airbnb app, and overlayed my components and design on top of the screenshots
                        for a pixel by pixel match. I inspected the website to find out the most similar font style available to
                        use as well, and colour matched components. <br><br>

                        I used existing decision making features - ie. the filters menu, the booking toggle, and confirmation
                        text on buttons to ensure consistency for everything added.

                    
                    </p>

                    <h3>Task 1: Making a Group</h3>
                    <div class="vertical-divider"></div>

                    <div class="header-image-desktop">

                        <img src="assets/group-create-airbnb.png" alt="" class="research-visual">
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="vertical-divider"></div>

                    <p>Based on my storyboarding, I concluded that there would be three main tasks that are crucial
                        to Group Booking, the first of which is creating the actual group where group members can 
                        decide on bookings.<br><br>

                        I used a flow that was very familiar to setting other filters and booking options for maximum consistency
                        across all tasks, not just Group Booking. Upon toggling the Group Booking option, mirroring the Instant Book
                        feature, the state of the toggle changes, and the button also changes to indicate a further step to be taken
                        to create a Group. <br><br>

                        The next challenge to tackle was inviting group members.
                    </p>

                    <div class="header-image-desktop">

                        <img src="assets/inviting-airbnb.png" alt="" class="research-visual">

                    <div class="vertical-divider"></div>

                    <p>Since Airbnb does not have an invite feature that allows for flexibility that allows
                        booking as a group, I looked towards external references for the the UX that gives
                        flexible access and settings for collaborative digital documents. I referenced popular tools
                        like Google Docs in order to introduce an experience that was consistent with the norm across 
                        the digital space that was also something that was familiar to many users. 

                       
                    </p>

                    <h3>Task 2: Managing a Group and Selecting Options</h3>
                    <div class="vertical-divider"></div>


                    <div class="header-image-desktop">

                    <div class="vertical-divider"></div>

                    <p>
                        Once a group was created, it opened up where the group is to lie, under "Saved" where lists reside
                        on Airbnb. This was to ensure users got confirmation when they created a group, but also so users
                        knew where to go to manage their group and choose a booking. This is consistent to how users
                        would normally save options to book, so it tied into managing a group.<br><br>

                        From there, members could manage their group, inviting new people, or managing group permissions through
                        exisiting Airbnb user flows.
                    </p>

                    <p>I built upon the exisitng Airbnb booking flow to ensure consistency across the application.
                        
                        When it came to payments, I gave users the ability to set whether they wanted to go by ratios (percentage)
                        or dollar amounts ($) when booking to ensure flexibility for different groups. This option is open once a group
                        selects a place to stay because ratios or payments may be different for different locations, making the meaning 
                        of payment inconsistent before a selection is made. Any group member is allowed to select a place to stay,
                        subject to approval from other group members, as indicated.
                        
                    </p>

                    <div class="vertical-divider"></div>

                    <p>

                        I included error messages, disabled button states, and indicators to ensure users were informed of potential
                        unaccounted payments or members. This ensures that a group booking does not go through unless all payment is accounted for,
                        and all group members confirm the booking.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Improving user experience after testing</h2>
                    <p>Using my Figma prototype, I selected a number of users to test tasks I had set up. There were
                        two groups among my user tests: <br><br>
                        1. People who have used Airbnb before <br>
                        2. People who have not used Airbnb before <br><br>

                        Both groups typically completed tasks successfully, but there were a couple of points of confusion, namely
                        payment for the booking. 
                    </p>

                    <div class="header-image-desktop">

                    <div class="vertical-divider"></div>

                    <p>Users noted that they were confused as to how much they were paying, versus how much the group
                        was paying. I iterated upon my design to ensure that there was a distinction made, and less confusion was to be had.</p>

                    <p>This was a really great project to work on! Although I focused on customer experience,
                        I also learned how to also think about the hosts, who are providing the services for
                        the customers, ensuring a design that was successful across the business. I learned how to make decisions that reflected both user and
                        business needs, as well as how to effectively iterate upon designs for customer success.
