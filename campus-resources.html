            <p class="intro">
                I tackled creating a user-friendly resource page for the first year engineering students
                who lived in residence at the University of Waterloo. I strived to ensure I designed
                an experience that was not only user-friendly, but included resources that were immediately
                relevant in helping my students achieve their academic, personal, and professional goals.

                        I would get information from Residence Life Management to relay to students, and also served as a
                        mentor to
                        learn about my students. I wanted to figure out the best way to support my students to learn and
                        grow
                        as well as keep them updated with relevant information.

                        I received several weekly updates from Residence Life Management to relay to students, but
                        if I sent weekly e-mails, the frequency would lead to lower student engagement and my
                        e-mails containing pertinent information would get ignored.

                        I wanted to support my students in developing themselves and feeling comfortable in residence,
                        but I didn't know what was important to them.
                    </p>

                    <p>To validate what I had in mind, using what I knew from interviews with the users,
                        I further broke down the problem.

                        <b>Methods:</b><br>
                        1. Interviews <br>
                        2. Surveys<br><br>

                        I conducted unstructured interviews to better understand how my users feel in their current environment.
                        I hypothesised that coop, academics, and social life would be both the root of users worries and goals
                        based on previous knowledge having been a student in their shoes once, too.<br><br>

                        By empathising with my users, and asking broad, open-ended questions, without explicitly bringing up my
                        assumptions, I was able to confirm my hypotheses
                        were right, but also why they were feeling certain ways. and what they needed. The survey provided data which supported the insights made from my interviews, validating
                        the problem ensuring I am designing to solve the right challenge.

                            to coop, academics, and community. I also learned my users primarily got their information online,
                            and that they preferred convenience of information so they could quickly judge whether investing
                            more time in an activity is worth their time.

                                page could be in. Finally, I started <b>wireframing.</b>

                        a clean guide to faciliate effective visual communication. I thought of a unique, bright

                        inspired by vocabulary and resources (ie. the UWaterloo website)

                            for continuity and cohesion. <br> <br>

                            I used a clean, well organised design, with plain language and sans serif font Roboto for accessibility.
