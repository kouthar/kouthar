                    <h3>Problem </h3>
                    <p>
                       As offices at the WSIB began to open again in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, the WSIB
                       had no efficienty and safe way to screen employees returning to COVID-19 for risk
                       factors.<br><br>

                       
                   </p>

                    

                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>
                        The solution I built in collaboration with my fellow designer and developers screens
                        WSIB employees in  under a minute, auditable almost instantly from a safe distance of 
                        over 6+ feet away.<br>
                       
                    
                       
                    </p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Users were wary of data privacy amidst logistical and safety concerns associated with returning to office</h2>

                    <p>
                       Using preliminary knowledge and researchs, I made assumptions along with my co-designer. We assumed
                       that due to the demographics of WSIB employees who would be using our solution, users would be less
                       tech savvy and more weary of data privacy. We learned that while anonymity was important,
                       tech savviness was very high!

                    <p> Conducting user interviews also allowed me to create a user map so that I could ensure I was designing the best 
                        experience for a secondary user - the auditor.

                    <p>At this point, the WSIB operations staff had passed on a self assessment we were to 
                        conduct with our solution. That took care of safety, but these sketches helped
                        me analyse what designs and flows would ensure a quick assessment time as well
                        as anonymity.

                        <p>
                            Following initial sketches, and wireframes, I designed mid-fidelity screens. I designed these
                            to centre my initial designs around contrast, type, size, and layout for accessibility. I also handed
                            off these screens to the developers so they could begin creating components in their code that they could
                            apply the design system to later.

                        <p>Although we found that the users we interviewed picked up on new tech pretty quickly,
                            we wanted to ensure we communicated every aspect of the app quickly and clearly to cover
                            all potential gaps in knowledge. 90%+ users breezed through the tutorial with no problems 
                            and learned why they were using the app and that the app did not store any data.

                        <p>The quick to finish assessement was designed so the assessment finished as quickly as possible.
                            The longest version of the assessment took less than one minute to finish, and with the large iconography
                            of the results screens, was instantly auditable. Cards informed employees of next steps for extra communication.

                            indicated that we achieved our goal of making a solution that was trusted and quick to

                                design system colours to adhere to AAA accessibility standards, to introducing
                                a carousel which gives easier access to information, and making results more easily
                                identifiable from 6 feet away, greatly improved the solution.

                        but just empathy. I learned to understand that when people are concerned for their privacy, that does
                        not mean they may not want to participate, but that they need to trust what they are participating in.

                        I also learned how to truly collaborate in a fast-paced environment, working with another designer, to 
                        project stakeholders, managers, and devs - it really takes a village to build a successful product.
